## Acknowledgements

During the course of the project, we were able to gain knowledge in the fields of Audio Processing and Deep Learning, and we found the experience of working on these topics very interesting. Hence, we express our deep gratitude to Dr. Dastagiri Reddy for giving us an opportunity to work on this project. 

## Aim

The aim of this project is to build a deep learning model using CNNs which recognizes emotion based on speech. 

## Introduction

Speech is a complex signal which contains information about the message, speaker, language and emotions. Emotion on other side is an individual mental state that arises spontaneously rather than through conscious effort. 

Speech Emotion Recognition is the act of attempting to recognize human emotion and affective states from speech. This is capitalizing on the fact that voice often reflects underlying emotion through tone and pitch. In this project we have used deep learning to implement CNNs to help us identify emotion in speech. 

There are various kinds of emotions which are present in a speech. The ones we will be analyzing for are: angry, calm, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, surprised, sad.
